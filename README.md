# IN Self Storage Computer Scripts
A collection of scripts we use to manage and maintain Windows-based computers here at IN Self Storage.

## Purpose
As with most scripts, they were born of a Systems Administrator who noticed himself/herself doing the same repetitive things over and over again, who suddenly remembered that computers are really good at doing repetitive, specific tasks. I'll spend some time in the present to make these scripts that will save me some time in the future. The intent is to create some simple, basic scripts that assist with initial setup and configuration of a fresh machine, as well as setup and configuration on a machine that's been in the field for awhile.
